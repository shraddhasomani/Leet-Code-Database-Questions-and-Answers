Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.

Point table:
+-----+
| x   |
+-----+
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
+-----+

Result table:
+---------+
| shortest|
+---------+
| 1       |
+---------+

Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point. 
The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 


Answer:

SELECT MIN(ABS(T1.X - T2.X)) AS SHORTEST
FROM POINT T1
CROSS JOIN POINT T2 
WHERE T1.X <> T2.X
;
