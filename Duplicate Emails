Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

Person table:
+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+

Result table: 
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+

a@b.com is repeated two times.

GROUP BY EMAIL
HAVING COUNT(EMAIL) > 1
;
